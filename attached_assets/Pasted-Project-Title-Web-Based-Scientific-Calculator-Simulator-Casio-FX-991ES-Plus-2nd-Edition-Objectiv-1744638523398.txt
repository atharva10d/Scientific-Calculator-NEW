Project Title:
Web-Based Scientific Calculator Simulator (Casio FX-991ES Plus 2nd Edition)

Objective:
Develop a fully responsive, web-based application that accurately simulates the Casio FX-991ES Plus 2nd Edition scientific calculator. The project should replicate the physical calculator’s interface, operations, and advanced features, while also integrating modern web functionalities such as a 3D viewer, interactive tutorials, and gamified learning modules.

Functional Requirements:
Scientific Calculator Simulation:

Replicate the physical layout and functionality of the Casio FX-991ES Plus 2nd Edition.

Include dual-line display for input and output.

Support all calculator modes: Basic, Scientific, Statistical, Matrix, Equation, Complex Numbers, Table Generation, and Integration.

Implement SHIFT and ALPHA key states with dynamic key behavior.

Provide full keyboard binding support.

Allow users to toggle modes, memory operations, and setup preferences.

Interactive History:

Maintain and display a history panel of the last 10–20 calculations.

Allow users to reuse or delete past entries.

3D Calculator Viewer:

Develop a fully interactive 3D model using Three.js or Spline.

Enable 360-degree rotation, zoom, and pan.

Provide options to toggle protective case visibility.

Add hotspots and labels for major parts like the solar panel, button sections, and display.

Educational Tutorials:

Dedicated "Learn" section for tutorials on features such as matrices, fractions, integrals, base conversions, and equation solving.

Include step-by-step walkthroughs, tooltips, embedded calculator examples, and collapsible “explain” boxes.

Use multimedia content (images, animations, screen recordings) for demonstration.

Challenge Mode (Gamified Learning):

Provide quiz-based challenges with timers and scoring.

Include question types such as:

Solve a math expression.

Identify required calculator mode for a task.

Time-bound conversions and equation solving.

Implement a local leaderboard (optionally backed by a database).

Store name, score, and timestamp for performance tracking.

User Interface and Experience (UI/UX):
Design a clean, accessible, mobile-first interface.

Style using Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for responsive layout and consistency.

Emphasize realism in calculator design to mirror the original hardware, including:

Button colors (e.g., yellow for SHIFT, red for ALPHA).

Typographic similarity using monospace or system fonts.

Glow or highlight for toggled buttons.

Provide theme toggle for light and dark modes.

Implement subtle hover and click animations using Framer Motion or CSS transitions.

Ensure cross-browser compatibility.
